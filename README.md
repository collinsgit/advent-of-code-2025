Trying out Advent of Code's 2025 problems. Will be attempting all problems in OCaml in order to learn the language.

# Usage
```bash
# dune build
# dune exec aoc <day>

$ dune exec aoc 1
> Day 1, Part 1: 1234
> Day 2, Part 2: 5678
```

# Notes
Tests are run on truncated versions of the full problem inputs. Expected values in test files do not spoil the actual solutions.
